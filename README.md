Project Summary 

This project is a 3D scene developed using computational graphics and visualizations. The scene includes objects such as an external hard drive, a USB wall connector, a container of gum, and an electric pencil sharpener arranged from left to right.

Approach to Designing Software:

To approach software design, several key steps were taken, including gathering requirements, creating a design, implementing the software, testing, and maintenance. Throughout the process, the end user's needs were considered, as well as the functionality of the software and any potential constraints or limitations.

Design Skills:

The project has helped to improve design skills by focusing on creating a visually appealing and functional 3D scene. The layout of the objects, lighting, textures, and camera movement were considered to create an immersive experience for the user.

Design Process:

The design process involved gathering requirements, creating a rough sketch, refining the layout and adding textures, and finally testing and iterating on the scene.

Tactics:

The design tactics used, such as considering the user experience and iterating on designs, can be applied to future work in software development. By taking an iterative approach to design and incorporating user feedback, software that is more functional and user-friendly can be created.

Approach to Developing Programs:

To approach program development, an understanding of the requirements and constraints of the project was gained, appropriate programming languages and tools were selected, and the software was tested and debugged.

Development Strategies:

New development strategies were used while working on the 3D scene, such as creating custom functions to make the code more modular and organized. A game engine was also used to render the scene, which required learning new scripting techniques and understanding the underlying game engine architecture.

Iteration:

Iteration was an important factor in the development process, as the scene was continuously tested and refined to ensure it met the design requirements and was functional for the end user.

Evolution of Approach:

The approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones of the project, from learning the basics of 3D modeling to implementing advanced camera movement and lighting techniques. As the project progressed, a deeper understanding of the tools and techniques required for 3D scene development was gained.

Computer Science and Future Pathways:

Computer science can help to reach goals by providing a foundation of programming and software development skills. These skills can be applied to a wide range of industries and can help to create software and technology solutions that address real-world problems.

Computational graphics and visualizations provide new knowledge and skills that can be applied in future educational and professional pathways. For example, 3D modeling and visualization tools can be used in engineering or architecture projects to create accurate representations of physical objects or systems. These skills are in high demand in industries such as video game development, architecture, and product design and can provide a competitive edge in the job market.
